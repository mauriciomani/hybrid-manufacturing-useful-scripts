Cutting a 1000mm by 600mm black acrylic in a small sculpfun s30 pro 10w, size 380mm by 385mm.

This guide ilustrate the steps to follow when your piece to cut is bigger both on the X and Y axis. However, should work similar if your piece is only bigger on the X (or Y) axis.

What you need 
* You need at least one known straight edge.
* An L ruler
* A didode laser able to cut black acrylic
* Lightburn
* White paint

Paint the black acrylic with white paint, only one side, this will help you create marks on the acrylic that will be used as reference points to ensure you are cutting correctly both on X and Y axis.
Wait until the paint has completely dry, most of the acrylic sheets have protective films so you will be painting over the protective film anyway.
Use the known straight edge to setup your laser machine, align one of the sides to that edge, you do not necessarily need to align the machine legs to the known edge but use it as a reference to take advantage of most of your acylic working space.

In case you need to take your legs outside the laseryou can cut legs support from the acrylic itself.

For this cases I recommend using the laser to make the edge cuts as well.
The most difficult part of this process is aligning the laser for X and Y axis. 
Let's imagine yuor known straight edge represents the bottom left Y axis (see image 1). Now you need to align it with the X axis, you are also going to help yourself with the laser engraving feature for this (and why white paint is necessary).
With an L ruler mark your 1000mm planned size over the X axis, this will help you make sure every time you move your laser to the right you are keeping it align with your self design X/Y.
Also with a ruler mark on the Y axis of the other side, you could also use this as a reference once you start moving your laser machine around. You are also going to help yourself from Lightburn target positions.
However using only target positions over such a big working area would not help.
