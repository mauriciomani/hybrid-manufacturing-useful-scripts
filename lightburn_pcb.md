To mill/engrave the pads do not use 254 DPI or a bit of solder mask will remain
Even without noticing if the copper pad is not bright it might still have some white solder mask, such as using 3,000 to 4,000 speed range and 14 to 16% power
Seems that power 25% is the best however, starting 23% works really good (23, 24, 25), with the following conditions
